# fuzzy-critters-gambling

A simple CRUD app using React, Node, Express, and Postgres.

[https://fuzzy-critters-gambling.herokuapp.com/](https://fuzzy-critters-gambling.herokuapp.com/) (Note: because it is deployed on Heroku's free tier, expect a slow initial load time of 10-15 seconds while the app wakes up.)
